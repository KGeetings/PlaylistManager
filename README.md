## Special Thanks
Huge thanks for both Auros and Zingabopp for their co-operation as well as their contribution to this mod.
Auros helped me do a full plugin rewrite with Zenject, allowing for a more optimized mod and Zingabopp created the BeatSaberPlaylistsLib library, which is what I depend on with this mod.
